\title{\pkg{openEBGM}: EBGM Scores for Mining Large Contingency Tables}
\description{
\pkg{openEBGM} is a Bayesian data mining package for calculating Empirical
Bayes scores based on the \emph{Gamma-Poisson Shrinker} (\emph{GPS}) model
for large, sparse contingency (frequency) tables. \pkg{openEBGM} includes
several important functions implementing DuMouchel's (1999, 2001) methods for
calculating the EBGM (Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean) score and the quantile
scores used to create credibility intervals. Some simple disproportionality
scores (relative report rate and proportional reporting ratio) are also
included. Adverse event report data are used as an example application. Much
of \pkg{openEBGM}'s code is derived from the \pkg{PhViD} package.
}
\section{Data preparation & squashing functions}{

The data preparation function, \code{\link{processRaw}}, converts raw data
  into actual and expected counts for product/event pairs.
  \code{\link{processRaw}} also adds the relative reporting ratio (RR) and
  proportional reporting ratio (PRR). The data squashing function,
  \code{\link{squashData}}, implements the simple version of data squashing
  described in DuMouchel et al. (2001). Data squashing can be used to reduce
  computational burden.

\section{Negative log-likelihood functions}{

The negative log-likelihood functions (\code{\link{negLL}},
  \code{\link{negLLsquash}}, \code{\link{negLLzero}}, and
  \code{\link{negLLzeroSquash}}) provide the means of calculating the
  negative log-likelihoods as mentioned in the DuMouchel papers. DuMouchel
  uses the likelihood function, based on the marginal distributions of the
  counts, to estimate the hyperparameters of the prior distribution.
}

\section{Hyperparameter estimation functions}{

The hyperparameter estimation functions (\code{\link{exploreHypers}} and
  \code{\link{autoHyper}}) use gradient-based approaches to estimate the
  hyperparameters, \eqn{\theta}, of the prior distribution (gamma mixture)
  using the negative log-likelihood functions from the marginal distributions
  of the counts (negative binomial). \eqn{\theta} is a vector containing five
  parameters (\eqn{\alpha_1}, \eqn{\beta_1}, \eqn{\alpha_2}, \eqn{\beta_2},
  and \eqn{P}).
}

\section{Posterior distribution functions}{

The posterior distribution functions calculate the mixture fraction
  (\code{\link{Qn}}), geometric mean (\code{\link{ebgm}}), and quantiles
  (\code{\link{quantBisect}}) of the posterior distribution. Alternatively,
  \code{\link{ebScores}} can be used to create an object of class openEBGM
  that contains the EBGM and quantiles scores. Appropriate methods exist for
  the generic functions \code{\link[base]{print}},
  \code{\link[base]{summary}}, and \code{\link[graphics]{plot}} for openEBGM
  objects.
