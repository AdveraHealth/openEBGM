openEBGM v0.8.0
===========

Changes:

* processRaw() now lists all strata when stratification is used.
* Added argument 'list_ids' to processRaw().


openEBGM v0.7.0
============

Changes:

* Added the autoSquash() function to automate data squashing.
* Changed exit condition for while loop in hyperEM(). hyperEM() now throws an
    error if the number of "stuck" or repeated estimates of theta exceeds 20
    when using 'method = "nlminb"'.
* Changed upper limit from 1 to 0.999 in hidden functions .updateThetaLL() and
    .updateThetaLLD(), which are called by hyperEM().


openEBGM v0.6.0
============

Changes:

* Changed 'keep_bins' formal argument in squashData() to 'keep_pts' for added
    flexibility.


openEBGM v0.5.0
============

Changes:

* Efficiency and code hygiene improvements to processRaw() and squashData().


openEBGM v0.4.0
============

Changes:

* Added the hyperEM() function to estimate hyperparameters using an
    implementation of the EM algorithm.


openEBGM v0.3.0
============

Changes:

* Added confidence intervals to autoHyper() and standard errors to autoHyper()
    and exploreHypers().
* processRaw() now returns Inf instead of 99999 when PRR results in division by
    zero.
* Fixed minor bug in exploreHypers().


openEBGM v0.2.0
============

Changes:

* Minor aesthetic changes to plot(), summary(), and print() methods.
* Relaxed convergence requirements for exploreHypers() and autoHyper().
